# Spello Consulting Foundation Library

## Available Classes

The Spello Consulting Foundation library provides some foundational classes for:

- [SCCommon](reference/common.md): Some common functions used by other classes.
- [SCConfigManager](reference/configmanager.md): Reading from and validating YAML style config files
- [SCLogging](reference/logging.md): Logging messages to the console and a log file and sending email in plain text or HTML format
- [CSVReader](reference/csvreader.md): Reading data from and and writing to CSV files
- [DateHelper](reference/datehelper.md): Date and datetime helper functions
- [JSONEncoder](reference/jsonencoder.md): Helps convert dicts and lists to json and back, preserving datetime and enum data types.

## Installing the library

The library is available from PyPi, so to add it to your Python project use pip:

    pip install sc-foundation-services

Or better yet, use UV:

    uv add sc-foundation-services

## Configuration File 
The library uses a YAML file for configuration. An example config file (*config.yaml.example*) is [available on Github](https://github.com/Spello-Consulting/sc-foundation). Copy this to *[your_app_name].yaml* before using the library. 

Here's the example file - the library expects to find the Files and Email sections in the file:

```yaml
